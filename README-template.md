### What I learned

I learned how to use unordered list in HTML and mastered the use of font files in my project.

```html
<ul class="profile-links">
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jachvictor">GitHub</a></li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/jachvictor"

      >Instagram</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>
```

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Inter"; /* Your custom font name */
  src: url("../../assets//fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf") format("truetype"); /* Path to the font */
  /* font-weight: var(--Weight500); */
  /* Specify font weight (optional) */
  font-style: normal; /* Specify font style (optional) */
}
@font-face {
  font-family: "InterRegular"; /* Your custom font name */
  src: url("../../assets//fonts/static/Inter-Regular.ttf") format("truetype"); /* Path to the font */
  /* font-weight: var(--Weight500); */
  /* Specify font weight (optional) */
  font-style: normal; /* Specify font style (optional) */
}
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions.

- Continue improving my mobile-first design skills.

- Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

- Using more of font files

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - Helped me understand the importance of semantic tags.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://web.dev) - his guide was essential for laying out the components.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Provided easy integration of custom fonts.
